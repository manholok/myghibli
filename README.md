# My Ghibli: Example Angular 4 starter 
Angular 4 just came out, so I was curious how this would differ from Angular 2. With the help of this project I will try and learn more about Angular 4.

## Public API used: Ghibli movies
https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/

I found this public API to work with. Actually I wanted to use some nice hearthstone API from Mashable, but I have trouble signing up. I already mailed support, I hope to get an answer soon.

## AngularClass and other starters
In the past I used the angular2-webback-starter of angularClass, but it has a lot of extra's that I don't use or understand yet. This time, I will try and slowly build up. Keeping the other project as a reference. And try and learn it all.
